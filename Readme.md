### Abstract
Wikipedia, the largest reference work ever created, is an online encyclopedia where anyone can contribute to collaboratively written articles. Its interconnected structure makes it an ideal platform to study navigation and human associations through games like Wikispeedia (play here). In this game, players navigate from one article to another using only hyperlinks, aiming to minimize the number of clicks. This project explores two central themes: the role of hubs—highly connected articles—and user navigation patterns. By analyzing the characteristics and usage of hubs, common and abandoned paths, and more, we provide insights into how Wikipedia’s structure influences player strategies and efficiency. Our findings aim to learn something about common knowledge, user patterns, and the interplay between structure and strategy.

### File Structure
**analysis.ipynb:** The main code for analysis contained in the data story is located here. This Jupyter notebook contains the primary logic and calculations for exploring Wikipedia navigation patterns and analyzing hubs.\
**src/:** Contains additional Python scripts supporting the analysis. You can find data processing scripts, and other components necessary for running the full analysis.


### Research Questions <br>
We have split our research questions into 3 key areas: <br>
1. #### Hubs <br>
* What are the defining characteristics of a hub?
* Which articles serve as the largest hubs on Wikispeedia, and how frequently are they used by players?
* What types of information are most often contained within hubs, and how are the hubs related to other articles or subject categories?

2. #### User Navigation Patterns <br>
* What paths are most commonly taken by players, and what does this reveal about public knowledge and associations?
* Where do players tend to "block" or abandon their paths, and what kinds of topics or articles are associated with these unfinished paths?
* How do common paths differ from lesser-used or “unintuitive” paths between the same articles?

3. #### Comparing Hubs and User Navigation Patterns
* Can we determine areas of common knowledge or knowledge gaps by comparing user patterns with hubs?
* How do hubs affect the efficiency of user paths? Do users who navigate through hubs tend to complete paths more successfully or with fewer clicks?
* Are highly linked hubs also more accessible, or do users tend to bypass them for other, potentially less-linked but more intuitive articles?
