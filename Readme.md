## Title: Wikispeedi-Know - Hubs, User Patterns, and How They Show a Common Knowledge Gap

### Abstract 
Our project uses Wikispeedia to explore the structure and gaps in our society's "common knowledge" by analyzing both popular articles and hub articles. We aim to understand which subjects are most commonly recognized, how players navigate between them, and where knowledge gaps may exist. By idenitfying highly visited articles and hubs (articles with many linkes) - we can analyze popular knowledge compared to specialized knowledge. Additionally, exploring common links in successful paths with unfinished paths will further help us understand public knowledge gaps. Finally, we compare hubs and user navigation patterns to determine whether hubs improve path efficiency or if users bypass them in favor of more accessible articles. Through these analyses, we hope to reveal insights into shared knowledge, intuitive navigation patterns, and the cultural biases embedded in these patterns.

### Research Questions <br>
We have split our research questions into 3 key areas: <br>
1. #### Hubs <br>
* Which articles serve as the largest hubs on Wikispeedia, and how frequently are they used by players? <br>
* How well do hubs facilitate movement through the network—do they lead to faster, more efficient paths to target articles? <br> 
* What types of information are most often contained within hubs, and how are these hubs related to other articles or subject categories? <br> 

2. #### User Navigation Patterns <br>
* What paths are most commonly taken by players, and what does this reveal about public knowledge and associations? <br>
* Where do players tend to "block" or abandon their paths, and what kinds of topics or articles are associated with these unfinished paths? <br>
* How do common paths differ from lesser-used or “unintuitive” paths between the same articles? <br>

3. #### Comparing Hubs and User Navigation Patterns
* How do hubs affect the efficiency of user paths? Do users who navigate through hubs tend to complete paths more successfully or with fewer clicks? <br>
* Are highly linked hubs also more accessible, or do users tend to bypass them for other, potentially less-linked but more intuitive articles? <br> 
### Additional dataset (if any)
We are not planning on using any additional datasets. 

### Methods

### Organization within the team 
* Michelle: conduct preliminary research on unfinished paths 
* Viktor: conduct preliminary research on shortest paths
* Antoine: conduct preliminary research on unfinished paths despite small semantic distance
### Questions for TA

Do we need to use all the data? Yes/No?

Definition of time out -  Can we assume if enough clicks then time out game was too hard to finish?
