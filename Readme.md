# ADA Project Milestone 2
Below is an outline of the requirements for the Readme.md file and information on the deliverables for P2.

## Title:

### Abstract 
Our project uses Wikispeedia to explore the structure and gaps in our society's "common knowledge" by analyzing both popular articles and hub articles. We aim to understand which subjects are most commonly recognized, how players navigate between them, and where knowledge gaps may exist. By idenitfying highly visited articles and hubs (articles with many linkes) - we can analyze popular knowledge compared to specialized knowledge. Additionally, exploring common links in successful paths with unfinished paths will further help us understand public knowledge gaps...

### Research Questions
####Understanding Hubs
Which articles serve as the largest hubs on Wikispeedia, and how frequently are they used by players? <br>
How well do hubs facilitate movement through the networkâ€”do they lead to faster, more efficient paths to target articles? <br> 
What types of information are most often contained within hubs, and how are these hubs related to other articles or subject categories? <br> 
### Additional dataset (if any)
We are not planning on using any additional datasets. 

### Methods

### Organization within the team 
* Michelle: conduct preliminary research on unfinished paths 
### Questions for TA
Add here any questions you have for us related to the proposed project.


### Additional things:
GitHub repository should be well structured and contain all the code for the initial analyses and data handling pipelines. Please use linked repository in description as a template

Notebook presenting the initial results to us. We will grade the correctness, quality of code, and quality of textual descriptions. There should be a single Jupyter notebook containing the main results. The implementation of the main logic should be contained in external scripts/modules that will be called from the notebook
